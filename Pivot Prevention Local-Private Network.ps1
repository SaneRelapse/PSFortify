# Pivoting is a hacking technique where an attacker gains initial access to a compromised system and then moves laterally through a local network/private to access other systems.
# This method is commonly used in post-exploitation scenarios, allowing attackers to bypass security controls and reach deeper into a network.
# This Script hopes to prevent these types of attacks.
